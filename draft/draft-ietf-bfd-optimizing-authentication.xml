    <section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">
      <t>Authenticating every <xref target="RFC5880">BFD</xref> control packet
      with <xref target="RFC1321">MD5
      Message-Digest Algorithm </xref>, or Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA-1)
      is a computationally intensive process. This makes it
      difficult, if not impossible to authenticate every packet - particularly
      at faster rates. Also, the recent escalating series of attacks on MD5
      and SHA-1 described in <xref target="SHA-1-attack1">Finding Collisions
      in the Full SHA-1 </xref> and <xref target="SHA-1-attack2">New Collision
      Search for SHA-1 </xref> raise concerns about their remaining useful
      lifetime as outlined in <xref target="RFC6151">Updated Security
      Considerations for the MD5 Message-Digest and the HMAC-MD5 Algorithm
      </xref> and <xref target="RFC6194">Security Considerations for the SHA-0
      and SHA-1 Message-Digest Algorithm </xref>. If replaced by stronger
      algorithms, the computational overhead, will make the task of
      authenticating every packet even more difficult to achieve.</t>

      <t>
	This document proposes that BFD control packets that signal a
	state change, a demand mode change (to D bit), a poll sequence
	change (P or F bit change) be categorized as a significant
	change. Control packets that do not require a poll sequence,
	such as bfd.RequiredMinRxInterval or
	bfd.RequiredMinTxInterval, are also considered as a
	significant change. In other words, the contents of an Up
	packet MUST NOT change aside from the authentication section
	without stronger authentication to take advantage of the
	method described in this document.
      </t>

      <t>In the Up state, most packets that are transmitted and received have no state change
      associated with them. Limiting authentication to packets that affect a
      BFD session's state allows more sessions to be supported with this
      optimized method of authentication.</t>

      <t>
	Once the session has reached the Up state, the session can
	choose the Auth Type to be one of:

	<ul>
	  <li>
	    No authentication, i.e., Authentication Present (A-bit) is
	    zero. Having no authentication provides computational
	    relief to the system. However, a malicious user can
	    blindly inject traffic that will be accepted by the BFD
	    session.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    <xref target="null-auth-type">NULL Auth Type</xref> as
	    defined in this document. This type prevents blind
	    injection, but is vulnerable to active attacks, where the
	    attacker is aware of the sequence number, and potentially
	    becomes the PITM. However, periodic check with stronger
	    authentication can thwart that attack as described below.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Meticulous Keyed ISAAC authentication as described in
	    <xref target="I-D.ietf-bfd-secure-sequence-numbers">Secure
	    BFD Sequence Numbers</xref>. This authentication type
	    prevents the attack when the Up packets do not change,
	    because only the paired devices know the shared secret,
	    key, and sequence number to select the ISAAC result.
	  </li>
	</ul>
      </t>

      <t>
	To detect a Person In the Middle (PITM) attack when the
	session is in Up state, implementations have two options. They
	can choose to use:
	<ul>
	  <li>
	    Test periodic strong authentication using a Poll
	    sequence. To perform a strong authentication, a Poll
	    sequence SHOULD be initiated by the sender. If a Fin is
	    not received within the Detect Interval, the session has
	    been compromised, and should be brought down. The interval
	    for initiating a Poll sequence can be configured depending
	    on the capability of the system.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Meticulous Keyed ISAAC as defined in <xref
	    target="I-D.ietf-bfd-secure-sequence-numbers">Securing BFD
	    Sequence Numbers</xref>.
	  </li>
	</ul>
      </t>

      <t>
	Most packets transmitted on a BFD session are BFD Up packets.
	Authenticating a small subset of these packets with a Poll
	sequence as described above, for example every one minute,
	significantly reduces the computational demand for the system
	while maintaining security of the session across the
	configured interval.
      </t>

      about the changes to authentication mode as described in <xref

    <section title="Authentication Mode  ">
      <t>The cryptographic authentication mechanisms specified in <xref
      target="RFC5880">BFD</xref> describes enabling and disabling of
      authentication as a one time operation. As a security precaution, it
      mentions that authentication state be allowed to change at most once.
      Once enabled, every packet must have Authentication Bit set and the
      associated Authentication Type appended. In addition, it states that an
      implementation SHOULD NOT allow the authentication state to be changed
      based on the receipt of a BFD control packet.</t>

      <t>This document proposes that the authentication mode be modified to be
      enabled on demand. Instead of authenticating every packet, BFD peers are
      configured for which packets need to be authenticated, and authenticate
      only those packets. The remaining packets MAY be transmitted and received
      without authentication, or use a less expensive authentication.
      For example, the two ends can be configured such
      that BFD control packets that indicate a significant change should be
      authenticated and enable authentication on those packets only. If the
      two ends have previously been configured as such, but at least one side
      decides not to authenticate a significant change packet, then the BFD
      session will fail to come up.</t>

      <t>
	The proposal outlines which BFD control packets are required
	to be authenticated. A BFD control packet that fails
	authentication is discarded, or a BFD control packet that was
	supposed to be authenticated, but was not; e.g. a significant
	change packet, is discarded. However, there is no change to
	the state machine for BFD, as the decision of a significant
	change is still decided by how many valid consecutive packets
	were received, authenticated or otherwise.
      </t>

      <t>
	The following table summarizes when the Auth Type should be
	set with a Auth or a OPT authentication type.  The table
	should be read with the column indicating the BFD state the
	receiver is currently in, and the row indicating the BFD state
	the receiver might transition to based on the BFD control
	packet received.  The intersection of the two indicates
	whether the received BFD control packet should have the
	Auth Type set to either Auth, or OPT.  The BFD state
	refers to the states in BFD state machine described in Section
	6.2 of <xref target="RFC5880">BFD</xref>.

	Some of the RPC operations in this YANG module may be
	considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
	environments. It is thus important to control access to these
	operations.
      </t>

      <t>
	There are no RPC operations defined in this model.
      </t>

      <t>
	The approach described in this document enhances the ability
	to authenticate a BFD session by taking away the onerous
	requirement that every BFD control packet be authenticated. By
	authenticating packets that affect the state of the session,
	the security of the BFD session is maintained. In this mode,
	packets that are a significant change but are not
	authenticated, are dropped by the system. Therefore, a
	malicious user that tries to inject a non-authenticated
	packet; e.g. with a Down state to take a session down will
	fail. That combined with the proposal of using sequence number
	defined in <xref
	target="I-D.ietf-bfd-secure-sequence-numbers">Secure BFD
	Sequence Numbers</xref> further enhances the security of BFD
	sessions.

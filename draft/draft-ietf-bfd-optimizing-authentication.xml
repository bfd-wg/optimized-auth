    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes an optimization to BFD Authentication as
      described in Section 6.7 of BFD RFC 5880. This document updates RFC
      5880.</t>
    </abstract>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>Authenticating every <xref target="RFC5880">BFD</xref> control packet
      with a Simple Password, or with a <xref target="RFC1321">MD5
      Message-Digest Algorithm </xref> , or Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA-1)
      algorithms is a computationally intensive process. This makes it
      difficult, if not impossible to authenticate every packet - particularly
      at faster rates. Also, the recent escalating series of attacks on MD5
      and SHA-1 described in <xref target="SHA-1-attack1">Finding Collisions
      in the Full SHA-1 </xref> and <xref target="SHA-1-attack2">New Collision
      Search for SHA-1 </xref> raise concerns about their remaining useful
      lifetime as outlined in <xref target="RFC6151">Updated Security
      Considerations for the MD5 Message-Digest and the HMAC-MD5 Algorithm
      </xref> and <xref target="RFC6194">Security Considerations for the SHA-0
      and SHA-1 Message-Digest Algorithm </xref>. If replaced by stronger
      algorithms, the computational overhead, will make the task of
      authenticating every packet even more difficult to achieve.</t>

      <t>
	This document proposes that only BFD control packets that
	signal a state change, a demand mode change (to D bit) or a
	poll sequence change (P or F bit change) in a BFD control
	packet be categorized as a significant change. This document
	also proposes that all BFD control packets which signal a
	significant change MUST be authenticated. Other BFD control
	packets MAY be transmitted and received without the A bit
	set.</t>

      <t>Most packets that are transmitted and received have no state change
      associated with them. Limiting authentication to packets that affect a
      BFD session state allows more sessions to be supported with this
      optimized method of authentication. Moreover, most BFD control packets
      that signal a significant change are generally transmitted at a slower
      interval of 1s, leaving enough time to compute the hash.</t>

      <t>To detect a Person In the Middle (PITM) attack, it is also proposed that
      a BFD control packet without a significant change be authenticated
      occasionally. The interval of the BFD control packets without a
      significant change can be configured depending on the detect multiplier
      and the capability of the system. As an example, this could be equal to
      the detect multiplier number of packets.</t>

      <t>The rest of the document is structured as follows. Section 2 talks
      about the changes to authentication mode as described in <xref
      target="RFC5880">BFD</xref>. Section 3 goes into the details of the new
      Authentication Type.</t>

    <section title="Authentication Mode  ">
      <t>The cryptographic authentication mechanisms specified in <xref
      target="RFC5880">BFD</xref> describes enabling and disabling of
      authentication as a one time operation. As a security precaution, it
      mentions that authentication state be allowed to change at most once.
      Once enabled, every packet must have Authentication Bit set and the
      associated Authentication Type appended. In addition, it states that an
      implementation SHOULD NOT allow the authentication state to be changed
      based on the receipt of a BFD control packet.</t>

      <t>This document proposes that the authentication mode be modified to be
      enabled on demand. Instead of authenticating every packet, BFD peers are
      configured for which packets need to be authenticated, and authenticate
      only those packets. Rest of the packets can be transmitted and received
      without authentication. For example, the two ends can be configured such
      that BFD control packets that indicate a significant change should be
      authenticated and enable authentication on those packets only. If the
      two ends have previously been configured as such, but at least one side
      decides not to authenticate a significant change packet, then the BFD
      session will fail to come up.</t>

      <t>
	This proposal outlines which BFD control packets need to be
	authenticated, and which packets can be transmitted or
	received with bfd.AuthType set to NULL even as Authentication
	Present (A-bit) is set. A BFD control packet that fails
	authentication is discarded, or a BFD control packet that was
	supposed to be authenticated, but was not, e.g. a significant
	change packet, is discarded. However, there is no change to
	the state machine for BFD, as the decision of a significant
	change is still decided by how many valid consecutive packets
	were received, authenticated or otherwise.
      </t>

      <t>
	The following table summarizes when the bfd.AuthType should be
	set with a Auth or a NULL authentication type value when
	Authentication Present (A-bit) is set. The table should be
	read with the column indicating the BFD state the receiver is
	currently in, and the row indicating the BFD state the
	receiver might transition to based on the BFD control packet
	received.  The intersection of the two indicates whether the
	received BFD control packet should have the bfd.AuthType set
	to either Auth, or NULL.  Most packets are NULL AUTH (Select)
	or the state transition is not applicable. The BFD state
	refers to the states in BFD state machine described in Section
	6.2 of <xref target="RFC5880">BFD</xref>.

      <t>If P or F bit changes value, the BFD control packet MUST be
      authenticated. If the D bit changes value, the BFD control packet MUST
      be authenticated.</t>

      <t>
	All packets already carry the sequence number. The NULL AUTH
	packets MUST contain the Type specified in Section 3. This
	enables a monotonically increasing sequence number to be
	carried in each packet, and prevents person-in-the-middle from
	capturing and replaying the same packet again. Since all
	packets still carry a sequence number, the logic for sequence
	number maintenance remains unchanged from <xref
	target="RFC5880">BFD </xref>. If at a later time, a different
	scheme is adopted for changing sequence number, e.g., <xref
	target="I-D.ietf-bfd-secure-sequence-numbers">Secure BFD
	Sequence Numbers</xref>, this method can use the updated
	scheme without any impact.
      </t>

      <t>
	Most packets transmitted on a BFD session are BFD UP packets.
	Authenticating a small subset of these packets, for example
	every one minute, significantly reduces the computational
	demand for the system while maintaining security of the
	session across the configured interval.

	Once the session has reached UP state, the session can choose

	methods, or Meticulous Keyed ISAAC authentication as described

      <t>The approach described in this document enhances the ability to
      authenticate a BFD session by taking away the onerous requirement that

      that affect the state of the session, the security of the BFD session is
      maintained. In this mode, packets that are a significant change but are
      not authenticated, are dropped by the system. Therefore, a malicious
      user that tries to inject a non-authenticated packet, e.g. with a Down
      state to take a session down will fail. That combined with the proposal
      of using sequence number defined in <xref

	This section carries the updated IANA BFD Module,
	iana-bfd-types.yang module, first defined in <xref

	Detection (BFD)</xref>. The updated module carries two new
	authentication type enum definitions, 'null' of value 6, and
	'meticulous-keyed-isaac' of value 7. This module should
	replace the version that currently exists in the IANA
	registry.
